# error_tutorial_deseq_contrast
Example to help identify problems in using contrast in DESeq2

I tried to follow the tutorial in but did not get the result expected:
https://github.com/tavareshugo/tutorial_DESeq2_contrasts/blob/main/DESeq2_contrasts.md

This repository contains the example I used and the unexpected results in Rmd and html format.
